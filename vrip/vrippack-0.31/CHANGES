Version 0.31
============
Cleaned up the makefiles under src to use one set of compiler flags,
src/compile-flags.  

Added compatibility with Cygwin.  Unfortunately, Tcl will not "exec"
through symbolic links, so the executables had to be copied over
directly into bin.  If one recompiles those executables, then they
must be copied over again.

Makefile checks for i686 flag before using -march=i686 and
-malign-double.


Version 0.3
===========

Updated for compatibility with newer compilers and newer versions of
Tcl/Tk.
