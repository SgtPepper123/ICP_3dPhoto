iv2ply -h | [-a] [(- | infile.iv) [outfile.ply]]

  Converts an Inventor file to ply format.
  Formerly: ivtoply


ply2asc < in.ply > out.ply

  Converts any ply file to ascii ply file.

  Formerly: ply2ascii


ply2bin < in.ply > out.ply

  Converts any ply file to binary ply file.

  Formerly: ply2binary


ply2iv < in.ply > out.ply

  Converts ply to Inventor file.

  Formerly: plytoiv


ply2verts in.ply out

  Converts ply file to an ascii list of vertices.


plyaddinfo in.ply

  Adds obj_info lines to the header of a ply file.


plyarea < in.ply

  Computes the surface area of a *triangle* mesh.


plybbox < in.ply
 
  Computes the bounding box for a ply file.
  
  Change: now uses pipes.


plybound < in.ply > out.ply

  Scales and translates a ply file to fit ina bounding box.


plycomps < in.ply

  Indicates the number of connected components in a ply file.  Also
  can be used select and write out components with enough vertices in
  them.


plycrunch < in.ply > out.ply

  Performs Rossignac and Borrel decimation.  If no tolarance parameter
  is provided, then voxel size is set to twice the average edge length.


plyflip < in.ply > out.ply

  Flips the normals and/or ordering of vertices in a ply file.


plyhead in.ply

  Prints out the header of a ply file.


plynormals < in.ply > out.ply

  Computes normals for a triangle mesh.


plyremove  < in.ply > out.ply

  Removes properties and elements from a ply file.


plyshared < in.ply > out.ply

  Collapses close vertices into single vertices.


plyunshared < in.ply > out.ply

  Duplicate vertices so that each vertex is referenced by exactly one
  face.


plyxform < in.ply > out.ply

  Perform scale, translate, rotate on a ply file.


crunch.tcl

  Calls plycrunch 3 times to create four levels of mesh resolutions.


plyvolume -h | [-p nx ny nz d] (- | file1.ply [file2.ply [...]])

  Computes the signed volume (and area) of the given ply files.
